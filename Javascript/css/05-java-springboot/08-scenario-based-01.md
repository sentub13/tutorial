## **Java – Practical / Real-World Scenarios**
0. **Your service is slow under high load. How did you identify and fix the performance issue?**

**1. **Your Java service started consuming high CPU in production. How did you identify the rot cause and fix it?**

2. **Describe a situation where you faced a memory leak in Java. How did you detect and resolve it?**

3. **How did you handle concurrency issues in a multi-threaded Java application you worked on? Give a real example.**

4. **You had to process a large file (millions of records). How did you design the Java code to avoid OutOfMemory errors?**

5. **Tell me about a time when you refactored legacy Java code. What problems did it have and what improvements did you make?**

## **Spring Boot – Hands-On Implementation Questions**
6. **How did you secure your APIs?6.**

6. **How did you implement global exception handling in a Spring Boot application, and why was it needed?**

7. **Describe a real scenario where you secured REST APIs using Spring Security. What authentication and authorization approach did you use?**

8. **How did you externalize configuration for different environments (dev, QA, prod) in Spring Boot?**

9. **Tell me about a performance issue in a Spring Boot application and what changes you made to fix it.**

10. **How did you implement pagination, sorting, and filtering in a real Spring Boot REST API?**

## **Microservices – Production Scenarios**
### Q5. *One microservice is down. How did you prevent system failure?*

11. **One microservice was frequently failing and impacting other services. How did you isolate and handle the failure?**

12. **How did you manage communication between microservices in your project (sync vs async)? Why did you choose that approach?**

13. **Describe a real scenario where you implemented circuit breaker, retry, or timeout mechanisms.**

14. **How did you handle distributed transactions across multiple microservices without using a single database transaction?**

15. **What challenges did you face while deploying multiple microservices, and how did you solve service discovery and routing?**

---

## **Cloud (AWS / GCP) – Practical Experience**

16. **How did you deploy a Spring Boot microservice to AWS/GCP? Walk me through the complete flow.**

17. **Describe how you handled application secrets (DB passwords, API keys) in cloud environments.**

18. **Your application went down in production on the cloud. How did you troubleshoot and restore the service?**

19. **How did you implement logging, monitoring, and alerting for your microservices in AWS/GCP?**

20. **How did you design your application for scalability and high availability in the cloud?**

==================




4. **Tell me about a time you faced concurrency issues (race conditions or deadlocks). How did you debug and fix them?**

5. **How did you optimize slow-performing Java code in a production system? What tools and techniques did you use?**

6. **Describe a scenario where improper object creation impacted performance. How did you reduce object creation or improve memory usage?**

7. **You had to implement parallel processing in Java. How did you decide between threads, ExecutorService, or parallel streams?**

8. **Explain a situation where you refactored legacy Java code. What were the main problems and how did you improve maintainability and performance?**

9. **How did you handle exception handling and logging in a large Java application to make production issues easier to debug?**

10. **Describe a situation where you had to tune JVM settings in production. What parameters did you change and why?**
