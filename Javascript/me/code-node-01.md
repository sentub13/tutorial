     - Cross-platform compatibility
     - Large ecosystem with npm (Node Package Manager)

### 3. **What is npm?**
   - **Answer**: npm (Node Package Manager) is the default package manager for Node.js. It is used to install and manage dependencies (libraries and packages) for Node.js applications.

### 4. **What is the difference between `require()` and `import`?**
   - **Answer**: `require()` is the traditional way of importing modules in Node.js using CommonJS. `import` is used in ES6 for modules, and Node.js now supports ES6 modules with `.mjs` extension or by setting `"type": "module"` in the `package.json`.

### 5. **What are callbacks in Node.js?**
   - **Answer**: A callback is a function that is passed as an argument to another function and is invoked after the completion of a task, often used in asynchronous operations to handle the result of an operation.

### 6. **What is the event loop in Node.js?**
   - **Answer**: The event loop is a mechanism that handles asynchronous callbacks in Node.js. It allows non-blocking I/O operations by placing operations into the event queue, which are executed when the main execution stack is empty.

### 7. **What is the purpose of the `process` object in Node.js?**
   - **Answer**: The `process` object provides information about the current Node.js process, such as environment variables, command-line arguments, and the ability to end the process.

### 8. **What is the `__dirname` in Node.js?**
   - **Answer**: `__dirname` is a global variable that represents the directory name of the current module (file). It is the absolute path of the folder containing the currently executing script.

### 9. **What is the `__filename` in Node.js?**
   - **Answer**: `__filename` is a global variable that gives the absolute path of the currently executing file, including the file name.

### 10. **Explain what is Non-blocking I/O in Node.js.**
   - **Answer**: Non-blocking I/O refers to the ability of Node.js to perform I/O operations (like reading from the file system or making HTTP requests) without blocking the execution of other tasks. It allows Node.js to handle multiple operations concurrently.

### 11. **What is the use of the `fs` module in Node.js?**
   - **Answer**: The `fs` (File System) module provides methods for interacting with the file system. It allows operations like reading, writing, and manipulating files.

### 12. **What are Promises in Node.js?**
   - **Answer**: A Promise is an object representing the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation. It provides methods like `.then()`, `.catch()`, and `.finally()` to handle success or failure of the operation.

### 13. **What is the difference between `process.nextTick()` and `setImmediate()`?**
   - **Answer**: 
     - `process.nextTick()` adds a callback to the next event loop iteration, before any I/O events.
     - `setImmediate()` adds a callback to the event loop, but after I/O events.

### 14. **What is the `cluster` module in Node.js?**
   - **Answer**: The `cluster` module allows Node.js to take advantage of multi-core systems. It enables the creation of child processes (workers) that share the same server port, improving performance and scalability.

### 15. **How do you handle exceptions in Node.js?**
   - **Answer**: Exceptions can be handled using try-catch blocks for synchronous code. For asynchronous code, errors can be passed as the first argument to the callback function, or by using Promises with `.catch()`.

### 16. **What is the difference between `spawn()` and `exec()` in Node.js?**
   - **Answer**: 
     - `spawn()` is used for launching a new process, and it streams data, so it’s suitable for long-running processes.
     - `exec()` is used to run a command in a shell and buffers the output, which is suitable for shorter, single-shot processes.

### 17. **Explain the concept of middleware in Express.js.**
   - **Answer**: Middleware is a function that receives the request and response objects, modifies them, and passes control to the next middleware in the stack. It is commonly used for logging, authentication, or error handling.

### 18. **What is the `Buffer` class in Node.js?**
   - **Answer**: The `Buffer` class is used for handling raw binary data directly. It is often used in network programming, file operations, or when dealing with binary data from streams.

### 19. **What is a RESTful API?**
   - **Answer**: RESTful API is an architectural style for designing networked applications, based on stateless communication and using HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to perform CRUD operations on resources represented by URLs.

### 20. **What is the use of `async` and `await` in Node.js?**
   - **Answer**: `async` and `await` simplify working with asynchronous code by making it look synchronous. `async` is used to declare a function that returns a promise, and `await` pauses execution until the promise is resolved.

### 21. **What is the purpose of the `http` module in Node.js?**
   - **Answer**: The `http` module allows you to create an HTTP server and client. It is used for building web applications, handling HTTP requests and responses.

### 22. **What is the event-driven architecture in Node.js?**
   - **Answer**: In event-driven architecture, the flow of the application is determined by events or messages. Node.js uses an event-driven model where events trigger functions (callbacks) to execute.

### 23. **How do you handle file uploads in Node.js?**
   - **Answer**: You can handle file uploads in Node.js by using libraries like `multer` that process `multipart/form-data` and store the files in the server.

### 24. **What is the difference between `null` and `undefined` in Node.js?**
   - **Answer**: 
     - `null` is an intentional absence of any object value.
     - `undefined` means a variable has been declared but not assigned a value.

### 25. **What is the purpose of the `path` module in Node.js?**
   - **Answer**: The `path` module provides utilities for working with file and directory paths, such as joining, resolving, and parsing paths.

### 26. **What are Streams in Node.js?**
   - **Answer**: Streams are objects that allow reading or writing data in a continuous flow. There are four types of streams: Readable, Writable, Duplex, and Transform.

### 27. **What is the use of the `eventEmitter` module in Node.js?**
   - **Answer**: The `EventEmitter` class is used to handle events in Node.js. It allows you to create custom events and register listeners to handle those events.

### 28. **What are the differences between `process.exit()` and `exit()` in Node.js?**
   - **Answer**: 
     - `process.exit()` immediately terminates the process with an optional exit code.
     - `exit()` is not a method of the `process` object; it’s used in other contexts like browser JavaScript or other environments.

### 29. **What is a callback hell, and how can it be avoided?**
   - **Answer**: Callback hell refers to the situation where multiple nested callbacks create unreadable, difficult-to-maintain code. It can be avoided by using Promises, `async/await`, or modularizing the code.

### 30. **What is CORS and how do you handle it in Node.js?**
   - **Answer**: CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) is a security feature that restricts how resources on a web server can be accessed from a different domain. You can handle CORS in Node.js using the `cors` package to specify which domains are allowed to access your API.

### 31. **Explain the concept of server-side rendering (SSR) in Node.js.**
   - **Answer**: SSR is the process of rendering the HTML content of a web page on the server side and sending it to the browser, improving load times and SEO performance.
