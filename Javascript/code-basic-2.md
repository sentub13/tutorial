### 1. **What is JavaScript?**
**Answer**: JavaScript is a high-level, dynamic programming language primarily used for building interactive websites. It is one of the core technologies of web development alongside HTML and CSS.

### 2. **What are the different data types in JavaScript?**
**Answer**: 
- **Primitive types**: String, Number, Boolean, Null, Undefined, Symbol (ES6), BigInt (ES11).
- **Reference types**: Object, Array, Function, Date, RegExp.

### 3. **What is the difference between `let`, `const`, and `var`?**
**Answer**:
- `let` and `const` are block-scoped, while `var` is function-scoped.
- `const` is used for variables whose values cannot be reassigned.
- `let` can have its value reassigned.
- `var` is function-scoped and can lead to issues due to hoisting.

### 4. **What is hoisting in JavaScript?**
**Answer**: Hoisting is JavaScript's behavior of moving variable and function declarations to the top of their scope during the compile phase, before the code execution. `var` declarations are hoisted, but `let` and `const` are not.

### 5. **What is a closure?**
**Answer**: A closure is a function that "remembers" its lexical scope even when the function is executed outside that scope. It allows access to variables from the outer function even after the outer function has finished execution.

### 6. **What are functions in JavaScript?**
**Answer**: Functions in JavaScript are blocks of code designed to perform a specific task. Functions can be declared using the `function` keyword or created as arrow functions.

### 7. **What is the difference between a function declaration and a function expression?**
**Answer**:
- **Function Declaration**: A function declared with the `function` keyword that is hoisted.
  ```javascript
  function greet() {}
  ```
- **Function Expression**: A function assigned to a variable, and it is not hoisted.
  ```javascript
  const greet = function() {};
  ```

### 8. **What are arrow functions?**
**Answer**: Arrow functions are a shorter syntax for writing functions in JavaScript. They don't have their own `this`, they inherit it from the surrounding context.
```javascript
const add = (a, b) => a + b;
```

### 9. **What is the `this` keyword in JavaScript?**
**Answer**: `this` refers to the context in which a function is called. It can refer to the global object, an object, or be `undefined` in strict mode.

### 10. **What is an object in JavaScript?**
**Answer**: An object is a collection of key-value pairs where keys are strings (or Symbols) and values can be any data type (including other objects, arrays, functions, etc.).

### 11. **What are arrays in JavaScript?**
**Answer**: Arrays are special objects used to store ordered collections of data. They are indexed by numbers, starting from 0.

### 12. **What is event delegation in JavaScript?**
**Answer**: Event delegation is the practice of using a single event listener on a parent element to manage events for child elements, which helps improve performance.

### 13. **What is a promise in JavaScript?**
**Answer**: A promise is an object representing the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation. It allows chaining of `.then()` and `.catch()` methods.

### 14. **What is the difference between `==` and `===` in JavaScript?**
**Answer**: 
- `==` compares values after type coercion (loose equality).
- `===` compares both values and types (strict equality).

### 15. **What is the use of `setTimeout()` and `setInterval()`?**
**Answer**: 
- `setTimeout()` is used to execute a function after a specified delay.
- `setInterval()` is used to execute a function repeatedly at specified intervals.

### 16. **What are template literals in JavaScript?**
**Answer**: Template literals are string literals that allow embedded expressions, multi-line strings, and variable interpolation.
```javascript
let name = "John";
let greeting = `Hello, ${name}!`;
```

### 17. **What is the `null` value in JavaScript?**
**Answer**: `null` is a special value that represents the intentional absence of any object value. It is often used to indicate that a variable should not point to any object.

### 18. **What is the `undefined` value in JavaScript?**
**Answer**: `undefined` is a type and value that is automatically assigned to variables that have been declared but not initialized. It can also be the return value of a function that does not explicitly return anything.

### 19. **What is the difference between `null` and `undefined`?**
**Answer**:
- `null` is an object that represents the absence of a value.
- `undefined` is a type that means a variable has been declared but not yet assigned a value.

### 20. **What is JSON in JavaScript?**
**Answer**: JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format that is easy to read and write for humans and machines. It is often used for communication between a client and server.

### 21. **What is the purpose of `Array.prototype.map()`?**
**Answer**: `map()` creates a new array by applying a given function to each element of an existing array.

### 22. **What is `Array.prototype.filter()`?**
**Answer**: `filter()` creates a new array with all elements that pass a test implemented by the provided function.

### 23. **What is `Array.prototype.reduce()`?**
**Answer**: `reduce()` applies a function to each element in an array to reduce it to a single value, such as summing all elements.

### 24. **What is `Array.prototype.forEach()`?**
**Answer**: `forEach()` executes a provided function once for each element in an array, but it doesn't return anything.

### 25. **What is destructuring in JavaScript?**
**Answer**: Destructuring allows unpacking values from arrays or objects into distinct variables. 
```javascript
const person = { name: "John", age: 30 };
const { name, age } = person;
```

### 26. **What is the spread operator in JavaScript?**
**Answer**: The spread operator (`...`) is used to expand elements of an array or object. It can be used for cloning or merging.
```javascript
const arr = [1, 2, 3];
const newArr = [...arr, 4, 5];
```

### 27. **What is the rest parameter in JavaScript?**
**Answer**: The rest parameter (`...`) is used to represent an indefinite number of arguments as an array.
```javascript
function sum(...numbers) {
  return numbers.reduce((acc, num) => acc + num, 0);
}
```

### 28. **What is the `typeof` operator in JavaScript?**
**Answer**: `typeof` is used to determine the type of a variable or expression.
```javascript
typeof "hello" // "string"
typeof 42 // "number"
```

### 29. **What is the `instanceof` operator in JavaScript?**
**Answer**: `instanceof` is used to check if an object is an instance of a specific class or constructor function.
```javascript
const arr = [];
arr instanceof Array; // true
```

### 30. **What is a callback function?**
**Answer**: A callback function is a function passed into another function as an argument to be executed later, often used for asynchronous operations.

### 31. **What are JavaScript modules?**
**Answer**: JavaScript modules allow the separation of code into smaller files, and they help in managing dependencies, using `export` and `import`.

### 32. **What is the difference between synchronous and asynchronous programming?**
**Answer**:
- **Synchronous**: Operations are executed one after another.
- **Asynchronous**: Operations can run independently, allowing other tasks to proceed while waiting for results.

### 33. **What is the `new` keyword in JavaScript?**
**Answer**: The `new` keyword is used to create an instance of a user-defined object or built-in object constructor function.

### 34. **What is the difference between `call()`, `apply()`, and `bind()`?**
**Answer**:
- `call()`: Invokes a function with a specific `this` value and arguments passed individually.
- `apply()`: Similar to `call()`, but arguments are passed as an array.
- `bind()`: Returns a new function, where `this` is permanently set to the provided value.

### 35. **What is the event loop in JavaScript?**
**Answer**: The event loop is a mechanism that handles asynchronous code execution in JavaScript. It allows the execution of tasks like callbacks and promises.

### 36. **What is the difference between a shallow copy and a deep copy?**
**Answer**:
- **Shallow copy**: Copies only the first level

 of objects, leaving nested objects as references.
- **Deep copy**: Creates a complete copy, including nested objects.

### 37. **What is the `eval()` function in JavaScript?**
**Answer**: `eval()` is a function that executes JavaScript code represented as a string, but its use is generally discouraged due to security risks.

### 38. **What are regular expressions in JavaScript?**
**Answer**: Regular expressions are patterns used to match character combinations in strings. They are used with methods like `test()`, `match()`, and `replace()`.

### 39. **What is an immediately invoked function expression (IIFE)?**
**Answer**: An IIFE is a function that is defined and immediately executed.
```javascript
(function() {
  console.log("Executed immediately!");
})();
```

### 40. **What is the `console.log()` method used for?**
**Answer**: `console.log()` is used to print output to the browserâ€™s console, commonly used for debugging purposes.
